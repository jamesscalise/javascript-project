# Travel Manager

##Motivation

This project was part of an assignment from the Flatiron School, where we were tasked with creating a project with a Ruby on Rails backend with a Javascript frontend. This was my first time working in a JS frontend, and since I love to travel I thought this would be a fun and simple concept to test out my skills.

##Tech/Framework

This project runs on Ruby 2.6 and utilizes Rails 6.0. Frontend is plain Javascript.

##Installation

After cloning the repository, simply run bundle install in the backend. In this repository, the frontend is fetching from where I've hosted the backend in Heroku. 

##How To Use
